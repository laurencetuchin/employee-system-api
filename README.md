## Efficient Management System for Organised Teams

#### Brief overview of the project, including its purpose and the problem it solves.

Our employee management system is designed to help managers keep track of important employee information and streamline team collaboration. With this system, managers can easily access and update employee profiles, track employment status, and set career goals.

Additionally, the system enables employees to create projects and assign tasks to team members, helping them stay organized and on track with their workload. By providing a central platform for managing employee information and project tasks, our system helps teams work more efficiently and effectively. It solves the problem of disorganized and fragmented communication, helping managers and employees stay informed and focused on their work.

- Custom exceptions: Throws unique exceptions based on whether an entity does not exist or there is no association between entities found.
- CRUD capabilities: Employees can create, read, update, and delete entities for employees, projects, and tasks, as well as assign associations between these entities using the controller endpoints.
